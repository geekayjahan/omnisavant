## PRESS RELEASE

### Omnisavant Helps Orgs Act on the Trove of Customer Signals They're Currently Missing

**Mid-to-large organisations can now turn buried conversations into insights, memory, and recommended actions before decisions are made on incomplete information.**

Omnisavant is a platform that helps companies stop missing critical customer signals buried in calls, tickets, emails, meetings, and feedback. Most companies analyze only the structured 10-20% of their data: the numbers in dashboards and reports. The other 80-90% sits in conversations, support tickets, meeting notes, and emails.[1][2] That's where intent, sentiment, and early warning signs live. Omnisavant makes that data usable.

### Problem and Background

1/ Organizations are data-rich but insight-poor. About $136 billion is lost annually to preventable customer churn in the US alone.[3]

2/ Critical signals get buried. A customer mentions a competitor on a support call. A product complaint shows up in three different tickets from different accounts. A key contact leaves and nobody notices until renewal. Research shows support ticket spikes correlate with 3x higher churn risk, and login decline appears 60 days before cancellation. Most companies miss these signals.[4]

3/ Teams operate on partial truths. The average enterprise uses 106-275 SaaS applications[5]. Sales sees one thing, support sees another, product sees a third. Almost half the organizations lack centralized visibility into data flows across these tools.

4/ Insights arrive too late. Customer health scores can predict most churn events, but only if you're tracking them. Proactive customer success reduces churn by 20-30%, yet most teams are still reactive.[6]

5/ When people leave, knowledge leaves with them. 42% of institutional knowledge resides solely with individual employees.[7] The average enterprise loses $4.5 million annually in productivity due to poor knowledge sharing.[2] There's no system that remembers what the organization has learned about its customers.

### Why Now

Four shifts make this the right time:

AI can finally understand unstructured data at scale. Large Language Models have made it possible to extract meaning from conversations, tickets, and documents. This wasn't viable two years ago.

Enterprises are drowning in conversations, not spreadsheets. Unstructured data is growing 3x faster than structured data, at 55-65% annually.[1] Rows and columns can't capture what's happening in customer calls and support threads.

Point AI tools don't compound. Companies are buying dozens of narrow AI tools. The average enterprise now manages 247 SaaS renewals per year.[5] None of them deliver shared intelligence across the organization. Half of them are shadow IT that leadership doesn't even know about.

Organizations need shared understanding, not more dashboards. Teams are more silo-ed than ever. What's missing isn't another tool. It's a system that gives everyone the same picture.

Omnisavant is the antithesis to a workflow replacement or yet another SaaS subscription. It's the layer that extracts hidden intel across the existing subscriptions.

### The Solution

Omnisavant pulls together unstructured data from across the company (customer conversations, product feedback, support tickets, emails, meetings) and turns it into three things:

- Insights your team can use today: what's emerging, what's at risk, what customers are actually saying
- Memory that persists: what the organization has learned, even when people leave
- Recommended actions: not just "here's what happened" but "here's what to do next"

Unlike dashboards that look backward at metrics, Omnisavant detects signals early and shows why something is happening, not just that it happened.

### How It Works

Omnisavant continuously ingests data from existing tools. No manual uploads. No configuration headaches. A context-aware engine interprets signals based on your industry, your company history, and your specific situation. Teams access insights through focused apps for Customer Intelligence, Product Intelligence, Revenue Intelligence, and Operations. All built on a shared core.

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q1: How is this different from BI tools, CX platforms, or social listening tools?

Omnisavant is not another dashboard.

| Existing Tools | Omnisavant |
|----------------|------------|
| Siloed, team-specific | Shared intelligence across the org |
| Retrospective metrics | Early signal detection |
| Charts and reports | Insights plus recommended actions |
| No memory | Persistent organizational memory |

### Q2: Why will this team win?

**P. R. Rajendran (CEO):** Exited gaming entrepreneur. Leads strategy, partnerships, and revenue.

**Priya Sebastian (CTO):** Former architect at Chargebee and Roof & Floor. Expert in distributed systems and data pipelines.

**Ramanna Shrinivas (Chief Usability Officer):** National Institute of Design (IN) and Bauhaus-trained design researcher. Drives adoption through usability.

**Mohan Gopalakrishnan (Product and Strategy):** Former Director of Engineering at Oracle. Early Norton AntiVirus author.

The team combines enterprise-scale engineering, product design, and go-to-market experience.

### Q3: How does the technology work?

Three layers:

1. **Unified Ingestion** Continuously pulls in internal and external data. No manual uploads required.
2. **Savant Engine** Understands signals in context: your industry, your geography, your company's history.
3. **Intelligence Apps** Customer, Product, Revenue, and Operations intelligence. Built once on a shared core, deployed everywhere.

### Q4: Isn't this easy to copy with LLMs?

The value is in the system built on top of LLM's capabilities.

Four things compound over time that are hard to replicate:

- Continuous data pipelines tuned to each customer
- Interpretation trained on company-specific context
- Learning from what actions teams actually take
- Memory that accumulates organizational knowledge

### Q5: What's the go-to-market approach?

We're running a fail-fast validation model, deliberately.

Rather than build for 18 months and hope, we're working with 5-6 design partners and 2 live POCs on real, messy enterprise data. The goal is to learn fast:

- Which insights actually drive action (not just interest)
- What makes teams change behavior
- How organizational memory compounds over time

**Initial wedge:** Customer and Revenue Intelligence. Chosen because buyer pain is acute, data volume is high, and feedback loops are fast.

**Validation:** If design partners aren't taking action on insights within 90 days, we pivot or stop. No vanity metrics.

**Expansion (post-validation):** Product Intelligence, Operations, Procurement, Engineering. All on the same platform core.

### Q6: How big is this opportunity?

Omnisavant sits at the intersection of two fast-growing markets:

**Customer Intelligence Platforms:** $3B in 2025, growing to $14-20B by 2030 (CAGR 25-28%).[8][9]

**Unstructured Data Analytics:** $10B in 2024, growing to $80B by 2033 (CAGR 23%).[10]

The opportunity is structural: 80-90% of enterprise data is unstructured, yet nearly all analytics spending focuses on the structured 10-20%.[1][2] That gap is where Omnisavant thrives.

**Our target segment:** Mid-to-large enterprises with high-volume customer conversations. Companies spending $50K-500K/year on fragmented customer intelligence tools today.
