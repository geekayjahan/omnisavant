## PRESS RELEASE INPUTS

### Q1. HEADLINE

**ANSWER:** Omnisavant helps companies hear the 80% of customer signals they're currently missing—buried in calls, tickets, emails, and feedback—and act on them before it's too late.

---

### Q2. CUSTOMER & PAIN

**Customer:** Mid-to-large companies with customer-facing teams that generate high volumes of conversations and feedback.

**Pain:**
- Critical signals are buried in calls, tickets, emails, and meeting notes
- Teams make decisions on partial information because data lives in silos
- Insights arrive too late—after decisions are already made
- When employees leave, the company loses what they knew about customers
- 80-90% of company data is unstructured, but most tools only analyze the structured 10-20%

**Quote:** [NOT PROVIDED IN V1]

---

### Q3. THE SOLUTION

**ANSWER:** Omnisavant pulls together unstructured data—customer conversations, product feedback, tickets, emails, meetings—and turns it into three things: insights your team can use today, a memory of what your organization has learned, and recommended actions. Unlike dashboards that show what happened, Omnisavant shows why it happened, what's emerging, and what to do next.

---

### Q4. WHY NOW?

**ANSWER:**
- AI has made large-scale understanding of unstructured data viable—this wasn't possible before
- Enterprises are drowning in conversations, not rows and columns
- Point AI tools solve narrow problems but don't build compounding intelligence
- Organizations need shared understanding across teams, not more siloed tools

---

### Q5. DIFFERENTIATION

**ANSWER:**
Omnisavant is different from BI tools, CX platforms, and social listening tools:

| Existing Tools | Omnisavant |
|----------------|------------|
| Siloed, team-specific | Shared across the org |
| Look backward at metrics | Detect signals early |
| Show charts & reports | Surface insights + recommend actions |
| No memory | Remembers what the org has learned |

The value isn't in the AI model—it's in the system. Omnisavant builds on four things that compound over time:
1. Pipelines that continuously pull in data
2. Interpretation that understands your industry and company history
3. Learning loops that improve from every insight acted on (or ignored)
4. Memory that persists even when people leave

### Q12. TOP RISK & DEFENSIBILITY

**Likely objection:** "Isn't this easy to copy with LLMs?"

**Answer:** The value is not in the model—it's in the system. Four things compound over time that are hard to replicate:
1. Continuous data pipelines tuned to each customer
2. Interpretation trained on company-specific context
3. Learning from what actions teams actually take
4. Memory that accumulates organizational knowledge

### Q13. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

**ANSWER:**
Three layers:

---

### Q14. NETWORK EFFECTS & DEFENSIBILITY

**ANSWER:**
Every insight acted on—or ignored—feeds back into the system. Over time, Omnisavant learns:
- What signals matter for THIS organization
- Which actions lead to outcomes
- How patterns evolve across teams and time

This creates a moat based on accumulated organizational context, not generic models.
